# Meal Planning with RTK

This was built as a weekend project to learn more about state management using Redux Toolkit. The user will be able to add a recipe to their meal planner by selecting a day/time and entering the url of the recipe. The request is then sent to the backend where Spoonacular's recipe extraction API is called and returns the recipe data. That data is then stored in local storage, with the logic being handled by redux-persist since storing non-serialized data in redux is not recommended.
